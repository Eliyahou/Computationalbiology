#### In this project we are checking the Genom of Bacillus subtilis bacterium
#### we Use the File BS168.gb ( a genbank file ) that has the genom sequence 
#### In our Code we can get any genbank file and do some checkings on it 
### 1.
### we get the amount of genes that are incoding to amino acid 
### we get the amount of genes that are incoding to RNA
### we get the amount of regulators
|genes incoding to amin acid   | genes incoding to RNA   | Regulators  |
|---|---|---|
| 4176  |30   | 330  | 
### 2.
### we get all the features that are in genbank file and their amount
